# JavaScript | Chart.js

Chart.js is an open source JavaScript library on Github that allows you to draw different types of charts by using the HTML5 canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you have to include a polyfill to support older browsers.

The HTML5 element gives an easy and powerful way to draw graphics using JavaScript. It can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions or do simple (and not so simple) animations.
It is responsive in nature that means it redraws chart on resizing of window for perfect scale granularity.

This library supports different types of graphs 

- Line
-  Bar
- Doughnut
- Pie
- Radar
- Polar Area
- Bubble
- Scatter

Example : The canvas would be a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content. An id attribute has been specified to refer it in a script, and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. The style attribute is used to add a border.
