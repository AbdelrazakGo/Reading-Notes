*Links allow users to click their way from page to page.*

first of all ,we Use the <a> element to define a link then 
we Use the href attribute to define the link address after that
we Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document and 
we Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link.

# LAYOUT

We use layout to display content in multiple columns.

![layout1](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif)



* Header: The part of a front end which is used at the top of the page. <header> tag is used to add header section in web pages.
* Navigation bar: The navigation bar is same as menu list. It is used to display the content information using hyperlink.
* Index / Sidebar: It holds additional information or advertisements and is not always necessary to be added into the page.
* Content Section: The content section is the main part where content is displayed.
* Footer: The footer section contains the contact information and other query related to web pages. 
* The footer section always put on the bottom of the web pages. The <footer> tag is used to set the footer in web pages.



## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

*
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.*

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

# objects

Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

for Example -->
In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop , All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

## built-in Objects

**Date, Math, String, Array, and Object.**

The built-in objects are Date, Math, String, Array, and Object. Each is used in a unique and not-quite-consistent way. Furthermore, newer versions of JavaScript (as found in Netscape "Atlas," currently in beta) implement several of these objects in a different manner than in Netscape 2.0. In this column we will address these built-in objects and how to use them. And we'll make note of the quirks you'll encounter as you apply these objects to your JavaScript pages.

![pair](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/img/PairMobProgramming/PairProgramming.png)

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

### Pair Programming Advantages

- An effective way to share knowledge
- Fewer coding mistakes.
- More efficient.
- Two heads are better than one
