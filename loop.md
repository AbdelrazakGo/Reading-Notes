# loops and iteration
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.You can think of it as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

- for statement
- while statement

## for statement

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

- for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

var i;
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}

## while statement

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

- while (condition)
  statement


  - while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
