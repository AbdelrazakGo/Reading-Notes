A domain model is a visual representation of real situation objects in a domain. A domain is an area of concern. Its used to refer to the area you are dealing with. 

## Domain Modeling 

Domain Modeling is a way to describe and model real world entities and the relationships between them, which collectively describe the problem domain space. Derived from an understanding of system-level requirements, identifying domain entities and their relationships provides an effective basis for understanding and helps practitioners design systems for maintainability, testability, and incremental development. Because there is often a gap between understanding the problem domain and the interpretation of requirements, domain modeling is a primary modeling area in Agile development at scale. Driven in part from object-oriented design approaches, domain modeling envisions the solution as a set of domain objects that collaborate to fulfill system-level scenarios.

The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.

The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the <tr> tag is used to create table rows and <td> tag is used to create data cells. The elements under <td> are regular and left aligned by default.

# JavaScript | Object Constructors


The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class.

**Object**: Object is the collection of related data or functionality in the form of key. This functionalities are usually consists of several functions and variables. All JavaScript values are objects except primitives.

Constructor: A constructor is a function that initializes an object. In JavaScript the constructors are more similar to normal java constructor.

Object constructor: In JavaScript, there is a special constructor function known as Object() is used to create and initialize an object. The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable. The variable contains a reference to the new object. We need an object constructor to create an object “type” that can be used multiple times without redefining the object every time.
