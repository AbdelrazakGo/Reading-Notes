**The <img> tag is used to add an image to an HTML page.**

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

![align](https://html-online.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/center-aligned-image-html.jpg)

*The align attribute specifies the alignment of an image according to the surrounding element.*

The <img> element is an inline element , meaning that text and other elements can wrap around it. Therefore, it can be useful to specify the alignment of the image according to surrounding elements.
