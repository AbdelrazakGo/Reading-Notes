**What is a list?**

A list is a record of short pieces of information, such as people’s names, usually written or printed with a single thing on each line and ordered in a way that makes a particular thing easy to find.

HTML offers three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list
elements.
The types of lists that can be used in HTML are :

- **ul** : An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.
- **ol** : An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.
- **dl** : A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

# CSS | Box 

**CSS box model** is a container which contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.
Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below:

- borders
- margins
- padding
- Content

**Border Area**: It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of border.

**Margin Area**: This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of Margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.

**Padding** Area: It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.

**Content Area**: This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.

# Arrays in JavaScript
*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values.*

In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

*Creating an Array*

**var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];     ** 

EX:

- var car1 = "Saab";
- var car2 = "Volvo";
- var car3 = "BMW";

Decision Making in programming is similar to decision making in real life. In programming also we face some situations where we want a certain block of code to be executed when some condition is fulfilled.
A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of program based on certain conditions. These  are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.
Java’s Selection statements:

- if
- if-else
- nested-if
- if-else-if
- switch-case
- jump – break, continue, return

*These statements allow you to control the flow of your program’s execution based upon conditions known only during run time.*

# Loops
Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. 

**while loop**
A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

**for loop** 
for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
