# Text 

- Headings and paragraphs
- Bold, italic, emphasis
- Structural and semantic markup

## Headings
Browsers display the contents of 
headings at different sizes. The 
contents of an <h1> element is 
the largest, and the contents of 
an <h6> element is the smallest. 
The exact size at which each 
browser shows the headings 
can vary slightly. Users can also 
adjust the size of text in their 
browser. You will see how to 
control the size of text, its color, 
and the fonts used when we 
come to look at CSS

## Paragraphs

By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.To create a one, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag

## Bold & Italic

- The <b> element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph) although the use of 
the <b> element does not imply 
any additional meaning
- The <i> element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
said in a different way from 
surrounding content — such as 
technical terms, names of ships, 
foreign words, thoughts, or other 
terms that would usually be 
italicized

##  Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules and Line breaks
There are two tags that can be used to control the layout of your page.

Horizontal Rule <hr>
Line break <br> -- inserts a end of line where it appear
Neither have a closing tag or associated text.

Their use is fairly straightforward.

## Visual Editors & Their Code views

What is a code editor? 
A code editor is nothing but a text editor that is specialized for writing software. It may be a stand-alone program or part of an integrated development environment (IDE). They make writing and reading the source code easier by differentiating the elements, so the programmers can view their code.

![html](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zwSXWQqb7bY/YDce2SXOTvI/AAAAAAAAAUE/mFx41fQDHeIx09L3t3a4T0Ua-PUyke4XQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2000/Backend%2B%25281%2529.jpg)

**Visual editors** often resemble 
word processors. Although 
each editor will differ slightly, 
there are some features that 
are common to most editors 
that allow you to control the 
presentation of text

**Code views** show you the code 
created by the visual editor so 
you can manually edit it, or so 
you can just enter new code 
yourself. It is often activated 
using a button with an icon 
that says HTML or has angled 
brackets. White space may be 
added to the code by the editor 
to make the code easier to read.

## HTML: The strong and em tags
The <strong> and <em> tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text. The <strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it. The <em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
-  They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

## WHY CSS? 

- **CSS saves time**: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
- **Easy Maintainence**: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
- **Search Engines**: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
- **Superior styles to HTM**L: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
- **Offline Browsing**: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.
### CSS Syntax:
- *A CSS comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.*
- *A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.*

![internal](https://i0.wp.com/blog.mallow-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CSS-inlineinternalexternal.jpg?resize=820%2C400.jpg)

- An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.

- An external stylesheet is a standalone .css file linked from a web page. Using external stylesheets, you can apply rules to multiple web pages. If you ever need to make widespread changes to your website design, a single change in the stylesheet can be applied to all linked pages, saving lots of time and effort.


![sumary](https://www.cienotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summaryblackboard.jpg)

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

**JavaScript Statements**

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

**DATA TYPES**

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## Decision-Making

![dicision making](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/es6/images/es6-decision-making.png)


 **conditional statements** are used to perform different actions based on various conditions. The conditional statement evaluates a condition before the execution of instructions.

*When you write the code, you require to perform different actions for different decisions. You can easily perform it by using conditional statements.*

Types of Conditional Statements
The conditional statements in JavaScript are listed below:

- if statement
- if….else statement
- if….else if….statement
- nested if statement
- switch statement
